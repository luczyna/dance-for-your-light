    <h1 class="centered">About the game</h1>

    <p>This game was built by <a href="https://twitter.com/tropvache" targe"_blank">@tropvache</a> for the Ludum Dare challenge. The theme for the challenge was "running of of space," which I chose to interpret as space to dance.</p>

    <p>Dance for your Light was built with <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>, as a mobile web game. I've been enjoying using this framework at work for prototypes, and wanted to continue getting to know more about it's testing and service approaches. I allocated a lot of time to making a "solidly" built game with the framework, and relied on super-fast visuals to get my dancing bone across.</p>
