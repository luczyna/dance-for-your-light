    <h1>How to Dance</h1>
    <p>You put your left foot in, you put your left foot out...</p>

    <p>In order to keep the light protecting you from the scary eyes beyond your perception, you must dance. And dance like you mean it!</p>

    <p>Use the buttons (or the 1-4 keys if you've got a keyboard), bust a move and create combos, bringing light to your world and keeping things bright for just a little while longer.</p>

    <p>Careful, though! Dancing and hitting those sweet grooves burns energy. Take a break to let your energy replenish. But keep any eye on the light, which will diminish without your awesome dancing. The light only appreciates fresh moves, so if you think you can get away with the same move, you'll be left in the dark quicker than you know it.</p>
